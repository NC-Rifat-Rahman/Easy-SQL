# Frontend
- In react app we want to track input elements and their values. The input will be the user prompt. So we use useState. 

# Backend
- The plan is to take input, the input will call API "x" which I created. The "x" will call the openAI API.
* api.js
- Here we configure our api
- in api.js "openai" is the object that we are going to use so that we can make the api calls;
    we did the configuartion to pass into our openai client.
    // cont openai = new OpenAIApi() Here we made an instance of the openai client.
